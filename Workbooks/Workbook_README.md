This Workbooks folder holds the waterSHED Workbook Excel files that can help facilitate the input process for the waterSHED model. 

Rather than inputting all the data into the user interface during each run, users have the option of saving the data in the waterSHED Workbook, which can then be uploaded into the user interface using the "Upload Workbook" button on the appropriate pages.
Instructions for using the waterSHED Workbook are provided in the Excel files.

Four files are provided including a clean version of the Workbook for new projects and three example projects from the Deerfield, Housatonic, and Schuylkill case studies. 
These example case studies can be uploaded using the option menu on the start page of the user interface as long as the waterSHED Workbook files are located in the "Workbooks" folder at the same directory of the waterSHED_main.py file.
These case studies use dynamic modules for the technologies, so they do not include any modules in the Workbook. 
Users should refer to the accompanying doctoral dissertation for example analysis of the three case study sites.
